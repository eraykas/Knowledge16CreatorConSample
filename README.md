## Synopsis

Sample to illustrate how to make code reusable by decoupling it through encapsulation of request/response objects in the ServiceNow ecosystem. The project shows how the same code can be used with either a ServiceNow processor or the scripted rest api.

## Motivation

For the AMI talk at the Knowledge 16 Creator Con to demonstrate the importance of keeping your code decoupled.

## Tests

The tests are written using jasmine which can be run by loading the Test/unit_test.html in a browser.
